      <h1>Learning Time Management</h1>
      <p>
        On September 2, 2023, I decided to get better at managing my time so I could balance school, personal projects, and free time. I started using a few simple methods that made a big difference in how I plan my day. 
      </p>
      <p>Here's what I did:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Worked in short sessions with breaks to stay focused and avoid burnout.</li>
        <li>Used a daily planner to keep track of what I needed to do each day.</li>
        <li>Set weekly goals so I always knew what I was working toward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These changes have helped me get more done, stay organized, and still have time for myself.
