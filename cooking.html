      <h1>My Cooking Journey</h1>
      <p>
        On December 20, 2022, I decided it was time to level up my cooking skills. I started trying out more challenging meals, exploring new recipes, and experimenting with different cooking techniques. My goal was to make food thatâ€™s not just tasty but also healthy. Along the way, I gained more confidence in the kitchen and discovered how fun cooking can be. 
      </p>
      <p>Some of my proudest moments in the kitchen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Made homemade pizza completely from scratch (yes, even the dough!).</li>
        <li>Learned to cook Japanese favorites like ramen and tempura (though, it's challenging and it cost me 1k+ for the ingredients.. shessh).</li>
        <li>Started meal prepping for the week, which saved me time and made it easier to eat healthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cooking has become more than just a way to make meals, it's a hobby I genuinely enjoy. I'm excited to keep trying new dishes and exploring different cuisines.
