      <h1>Started Reading Daily</h1>
      <p>
        On October 5, 2022, I decided to make reading a daily habit. I aimed to read any books whether it's fictional, non-fiction, personal development books, each day, but you can also say that some of what I'm reading it's not really a books but I consider it a book because it's also have a page or chapter more like of a books but the only different are the contents, though It's fictional but in some way you can learn a lot from it. This practice has helped me improve my vocabulary, expand my knowledge, and unwind after a busy day.

        My favorite books/novels so far include:
      </p>
      <ul> 
        <li>"Atomic Habits" by James Clear</li>
        <li>"Return of the Mount Hua Sect" by Biga</li>
        <li>"Deep Work" by Cal Newport</li>
        <li>"The Infinite Mage" by Kim chi Woo</li>
        <li>"The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle</li>
        <li>"The Beginning After the End" by Tae Ha Lee</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reading has become an essential part of my routine, and I plan to continue this journey for years to come.
